Reasoning

Hello, this is my code for the Engineering Intern Prompt.
Thank you for taking the time to read my code and I would love to use my skills on showcase in this repository on the Sports Reference team!

Firstly, since the prompt asked for any high level language, I chose Python. I chose Python because it is the language I am most familiar with and was the first language I used to code with. I have also made a Slot Machine in python which you can both find here and is presented on my resume.

Secondly, since you said the data itself did not matter, I chose the data provided in the example, to show that I know exactly how to code what is asked and be able to present that information in a table.
