Reasoning

Hello, this is my code for the Engineering Intern Prompt.
Thank you for taking the time to read my code and I would love to use my skills on showcase in this repository on the Sports Reference team!

Firstly, since the prompt asked for any high level language, I chose Python. I chose Python because it is the language I am most familiar with and was the first language I used to code with. I have also made a Slot Machine in python which you can both find on my Github and is presented on my resume.

Secondly, since you said the data itself did not matter, I chose the data provided in the example, to show that I know exactly how to code what is asked and be able to present that information in a table.

Breakdown of the code:

Lines 1-78: Showcases the data in use and uses it through a multiline string titled "teams_data_json" that has the data for direct W-L for each team against each other.

Line 80: The usage of "json.loads" brings the json data into the python dictionary, which is now presented as "teams_data".

Line 82: Converts the teams from the dictionary into a list.

Line 84: Prints the team names in the header, which is seperated by the tabs "\t" + "\t"

Line 86-87: Loop iterates through each team and prints out rows representing teams head to head records. Uses nested comprehension to format wins and losses

Line 89: Prints team names in footer, used for if a user is scrolling at the bottom they can still recognize what team it is. Also seperated by tabs using "\t" + "\t"

Once again thank you for reading my code, I can't wait for the next steps and would love to discuss more I can help bring to the team!
